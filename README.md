# hello-world
learning to code, it won't be easy but definitely a necessity.

hi there, this is the first time that I am using Github, learnign to understand branches, commit, pull-request, and merge pull request. I hope this is something that i can pick-up rather easy. I hope to take advantage of the visual basic community IDE and API uses.
